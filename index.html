        <h2>About</h2>
        	<p>
				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				The ROCA ontology (RObotics, Cognition, Archaeology) is a novel ontology designed to describe behavioural processes such as tool use and tool making in the context of robotics, archaeology, and primatology, with a focus on observational data. 
				
				<h3>The origin</h3>
				 The <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/over/afdelingen/materials-science-and-engineering/research/art-and-archaeology/projects/ancient-adhesives-a-window-on-prehistoric-technological-complexity">Ancient Adhesives project</a>, 
				 led by Dr. Geeske Langejans, 
				 aims to create new computational methods to study technological complexities in (pre)historic times to shed light to the evolution of hominin cognitive capabilities. 
				 In particular, the project employs automated formal methods to model and compare adhesive technologies, that are the oldest examples of highly complex technology. A spin-off project named ROCA (Rrobotics and cognitive archaeology) was launched in partnership with Pierre Mercuriali and Carlos Hernandez Corbato of the 
				 <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/over/afdelingen/cognitive-robotics-cor">Cognitive Robotics Department</a> at TUDelft. 
				 The ROCA ontology hosted in this website is an output of this project. 
				
				<h3>What are ontologies?</h3>
				Ontologies can be seen as expressive taxonomies. Like taxonomies, ontologies contain subsumption relations, e.g., to express that the concept of a Hammer is more specific than the concept of a Tool. Ontologies can also contain more complex relations, such as temporal relationships between actions, as well as concrete instances of concepts, such as a specific chimpanzee being observed as opposed to the general concept of Chimpanzee.

      			The ROCA ontology is split into two: 
					 
				 <ul>
					<li>Concepts and relations: <a href="roca.owl">roca.owl</a></li>
					<li>Instances: <a href="roca_instances.owl">roca_instances.owl</a> </br>
					    (curated from the literature and described using the concepts and relations)</li>
				</ul>
